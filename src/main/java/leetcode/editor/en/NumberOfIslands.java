/**
 * Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0
 * 's (water), return the number of islands.
 * <p>
 * An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands
 * horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all
 * surrounded by water.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input: grid = [
 * ["1","1","1","1","0"],
 * ["1","1","0","1","0"],
 * ["1","1","0","0","0"],
 * ["0","0","0","0","0"]
 * ]
 * Output: 1
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input: grid = [
 * ["1","1","0","0","0"],
 * ["1","1","0","0","0"],
 * ["0","0","1","0","0"],
 * ["0","0","0","1","1"]
 * ]
 * Output: 3
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * m == grid.length
 * n == grid[i].length
 * 1 <= m, n <= 300
 * grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.
